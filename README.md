# ToDoListApp
A simple to-do list app in Android, building mainly to learn more about Android myself, but the intent is to turn it into a fully functioning app in the future.

# TODO - 3/5/17
+ Order the views in the MainActivity by priority.
+ When you click on a task name, it takes you to another screen that shows you more data about the task.
+ Add a due date field for tasks.
+ Send a notification on the due date for tasks.
+ Make each task expandable, and put the priority and due date in the expandable section.

# UPDATES - 3/5/17
+ Databases honestly make this thing so easy. Only took about half an hour to get three to-do's done from the previous list!

# BUGS - 3/5/17
+ When you execute DROP TABLE on the database, the app crashes. Although, this was discovered by complete accident and should theoretically never happen :)
