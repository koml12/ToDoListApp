# ToDoListApp
A simple to-do list app in Android, building mainly to learn more about Android myself, but the intent is to turn it into a fully functioning app in the future.

# UPDATES - 4/22/17
+ The app is officially done! Didn't get to put in notifications, but I'm okay with it.

# BUGS - 4/22/17
+ You can add tasks that don't have any text. Since this is just a personal use app, I'm not worried about it.
