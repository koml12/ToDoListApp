# ToDoListApp
A simple to-do list app in Android, building mainly to learn more about Android myself, but the intent is to turn it into a fully functioning app in the future.

# TODO
+ Re-introduce the "task" object originally used in the RecyclerView. In order for the app to compile, it might be necessary to just get the String taskName from these objects, and pass an array of those through activities.
+ Add database functionality. Will require learning about databases and how to use them in Android, as well as rewriting a lot of the code to accommodate the database. Possibly won't even end up passing data through intents?
+ Add a "priority" setting for each task, either "low", "medium", or "high". 
+ Order the views in the MainActivity by priority.
+ When you click on a task name, it takes you to another screen that shows you more data about the task.
+ Change the colors of the tasks to reflect the priority of them.
