# ToDoListApp
A simple to-do list app in Android, building mainly to learn more about Android myself, but the intent is to turn it into a fully functioning app in the future.

# TODO - 4/22/17
+ Material design UI
+ Notifications? Maybe

# UPDATES - 4/22/17
+ Just about done with this app. Need to make a couple small changes, then this repo is going public! 

# BUGS - 4/22/17
+ For some reason every time there's a change to the database (add columns or delete columns), I need to force drop the table, and add it manually in the code, causing the app to crash a couple of times before it starts working normally again.
