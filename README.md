# ToDoListApp
A simple to-do list app in Android, building mainly to learn more about Android myself, but the intent is to turn it into a fully functioning app in the future.

# TODO - 2/27/17
+ Clean up code and delete unnecessary sections in MainActivity and AddTaskActivity, also look into variable names and other descriptive type things.
+ Add a "priority" setting for each task, either "low", "medium", or "high". 
+ Order the views in the MainActivity by priority.
+ When you click on a task name, it takes you to another screen that shows you more data about the task.
+ Change the colors of the tasks to reflect the priority of them.

# UPDATES - 2/27/17
+ Added a second activity that adds tasks to the database. No more using key-value pairs to pass through intents!

# BUGS - 2/27/17
+ When you execute DROP TABLE on the database, the app crashes. Although, this was discovered by complete accident and should theoretically never happen :)
